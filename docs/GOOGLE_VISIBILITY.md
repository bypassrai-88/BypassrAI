# How to get Bypassr AI showing on Google

If you search "bypassr ai" or "bypassrai" and your site doesn’t appear, use these steps to improve visibility and speed up indexing.

---

## 1. Google Search Console (do this first)

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
2. **Property:** Make sure you have a property for `https://bypassrai.com` (not only www). Add it if needed and verify (DNS or HTML file).
3. **Submit sitemap:**  
   - Left menu → **Sitemaps**.  
   - Enter: `https://bypassrai.com/sitemap.xml`  
   - Click **Submit**.
4. **Request indexing for key URLs:**  
   - Left menu → **URL Inspection**.  
   - Enter each URL and click **Request indexing** (don’t overdo it; a few key pages are enough):  
     - `https://bypassrai.com/`  
     - `https://bypassrai.com/humanize`  
     - `https://bypassrai.com/pricing`  
     - `https://bypassrai.com/ai-check`  
   This asks Google to crawl and consider indexing those pages sooner.

## 2. What we changed on the site

- **Brand:** Title and description use **"Bypassr AI"** (with a space) so the brand search matches.
- **Keyword phrases:** We added **"AI humanizer"**, **"humanize AI"**, **"bypass AI"** (and "bypass AI detection") in:
  - Default layout title/description (site-wide)
  - Homepage: hero, steps section, final CTA heading, FAQ
  - Humanize page: title, description, and body copy
  - Pricing page: title and description
  - AI Check page: title and description
  - Help page: title and description  

So searches like **"ai humanizer"**, **"humanize ai"**, **"bypass ai"**, **"humanize ai text"**, **"bypass ai detection"** can match your pages. You still need to be indexed (see steps above).

## 3. Why you might still not see it yet

- **Indexing delay:** New or low-authority sites often take **days to a few weeks** to show up for brand searches. Requesting indexing in GSC can speed it up but doesn’t guarantee immediate results.
- **Crawl budget:** Google crawls small sites less often. Submitting the sitemap and requesting indexing for the homepage and main product pages helps.
- **Competition:** For generic terms like "AI humanizer," bigger sites will rank first. For your **brand name** ("bypassr ai"), once the site is indexed it should eventually show when people search that.

## 4. Check if you’re indexed

- In Search Console: **Coverage** (or **Pages**) → see how many URLs are "Indexed."
- Or search on Google: `site:bypassrai.com`  
  - If you see your pages, you’re indexed; it may just take more time to show for "bypassr ai."
  - If you see nothing, keep the sitemap submitted and use URL Inspection → Request indexing on the homepage.

## 5. Optional: Bing Webmaster Tools

- Add your site at [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters) and submit the same sitemap.  
- Some search traffic comes from Bing; it’s quick to set up.

## Summary

1. In **Search Console**: add property for `https://bypassrai.com`, submit `https://bypassrai.com/sitemap.xml`, and use **URL Inspection → Request indexing** for the homepage and a few key pages.  
2. The site is already set up with **"Bypassr AI"** in title, description, and on the homepage.  
3. Give it **1–2 weeks** and check again for `site:bypassrai.com` and "bypassr ai."
