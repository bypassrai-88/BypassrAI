## 2. Are our prices too high or words too low?

### Entry tier (Regular $9 / 10K words)

- **Same 10K words:** NaturalWrite Basic is **$5.99** (1,669 words/$), Undetectable yearly is **$5** (2,000 words/$). We’re **$3–4 higher** for the same 10K.
- **Same price ballpark:** AI Humanizer Basic is $9.99/10K — we’re **in line**.
- **Much more words at similar price:** Humanize AI Essential $7/30K (4,286 words/$), GPTHuman Starter $8.25/25K (3,030 words/$), HumanizerPro $7/15K (2,143 words/$).

**Verdict:** At **$9 for 10K**, we’re **slightly high** vs NaturalWrite and Undetectable (they give 10K for $5–6). We’re **low on words** vs Humanize AI and GPTHuman (they give 25–30K in the $7–8 range). So: **price a bit high and/or words a bit low** for the entry tier.

### Mid tier (Pro $15 / 25K words)

- We give **25K** for **$15** (1,667 words/$). NaturalWrite Pro gives **20K** for **$15.99** — we give **more words** at a similar price.
- GPTHuman gives **25K for $8.25** (yearly) and **60K for $14** — they’re much more generous.
- HumanizerPro gives **50K for $12** — double our words for less money.

**Verdict:** We’re **competitive with NaturalWrite** (we give more words). We’re **weaker on value** vs GPTHuman and HumanizerPro (fewer words per dollar).

### Premium tier ($25 / 50K words)

- We give **50K** for **$25** (2,000 words/$). AI Humanizer Pro gives **50K for $19.99** — **same words, ~$5 cheaper** elsewhere.
- GPTHuman **Unlimited** is **$26** (yearly) — unlimited words.
- HumanizerPro **Advanced** is **$19** for **1M words** — far more words for less.

**Verdict:** At **$25 for 50K** we’re **high** vs AI Humanizer ($20/50K) and **much lower value** vs HumanizerPro/GPTHuman (unlimited or 1M for $19–26).

## 4. Recommendations

**If you want to be clearly competitive on “words per dollar”:**

| Tier | Option A (lower price) | Option B (more words) | Option C (both) |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Regular** | $6–7/mo, keep 10K | Keep $9, raise to **15K** | $7–8/mo, **12–15K** words |
| **Pro** | $12/mo, keep 25K | Keep $15, raise to **35–40K** | $12–14/mo, **40–50K** words |
| **Premium** | $19–20/mo, keep 50K | Keep $25, raise to **75–100K** | $20–22/mo, **60–80K** words |

**If you’re okay being “premium positioned”:**  
Keeping current prices is fine if you compete on **quality** (Claude, detector, UX) rather than raw words. Many competitors at $5–7 are yearly-only or aggressive promos; your margins stay strong at $9/15/25.

**Bottom line:**  
- **Prices:** Slightly high vs Undetectable/NaturalWrite at entry; a bit high vs AI Humanizer/HumanizerPro at mid and premium.  
- **Words:** A bit low vs Humanize AI, GPTHuman, HumanizerPro (they give 25–60K+ at $7–15).  
- **Easiest tweaks:** Give **more words** at same price (e.g. Regular 12–15K, Pro 35K, Premium 65–75K) and/or **drop entry to $7–8** to match NaturalWrite/Undetectable. Re-run [PROFIT_MARGINS.md](./PROFIT_MARGINS.md) after any change.

## 5. Decision: Keep current prices

**We're keeping $9 / $15 / $25.** It's easy to **lower** prices later (customers are happy); **raising** them is much harder and can cause churn. Start at current pricing; if we want to be more aggressive on value later, we can drop price or add words without the pain of a price increase.
